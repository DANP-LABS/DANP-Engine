The architecture consists of four main layers:

* IPFS Storage Layer: Decentralized storage network that provides content-addressable storage for WASM modules and application data
* WASM Runtime Layer: Distributed execution environment where WASM modules run with AI Agent capabilities
* Application Layer: Core functionalities exposed to developers including Edge AI, Trusted Computing and Edge Functions
* Services Layer: Final output services that applications can consume (Compute, Storage, Network)
