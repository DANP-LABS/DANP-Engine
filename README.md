**DANP-Engine** is a trusted AI MCP runtime built on **IPFS**, **WASM**, **AI MCP Server** and **AI MCP Client**. The AI MCP tools modules are stored on decentralized IPFS immutable trusted storage. This innovative framework seamlessly integrates WebAssembly computing, IPFS storage, and AI Agent capabilities to deliver a robust, serverless solution for decentralized applications (dApps). Designed to empower developers with cutting-edge technologies, this project revolutionizes decentralized computing by combining the efficiency of WASM, the reliability of IPFS, and the intelligence of AI Agents.

The architecture consists of four main layers:

* IPFS Storage Layer: Decentralized storage network that provides content-addressable storage for WASM modules and application data
* WASM Runtime Layer: Distributed execution environment where WASM modules run with AI Agent capabilities
* Application Layer: Core functionalities exposed to developers including Edge AI, Trusted Computing and Edge Functions
* Services Layer: Final output services that applications can consume (Compute, Storage, Network)

## How It's Made

**DANP-Engine** is built on four core components that work together to provide a trusted AI MCP runtime:

### IPFS Foundation
- **Role**: Provides decentralized, immutable storage for WASM modules and AI tools
- **Implementation**: 
  - Integrated IPFS nodes for distributed content addressing
  - Uses Filecoin-Lassie for efficient IPFS file retrieval
  - Supports IPFS Car file extraction via Filecoin-IPLD-Go-Car

### WASM Runtime
- **Role**: Executes trusted, portable code in a secure sandbox
- **Implementation**:
  - Leverages wazero for efficient WASM execution
  - Uses Extism for WASM plugin management
  - Supports both local and IPFS-hosted WASM modules

### AI MCP Server
- **Role**: Hosts and manages AI tools and services
- **Implementation**:
  - Built with Fiber for high-performance HTTP serving
  - Provides tool registration and discovery
  - Manages WASM module lifecycle and execution

### AI MCP Client
- **Role**: Interfaces with the MCP Server and provides user access
- **Implementation**:
  - Supports multiple client implementations (CLI, Web, etc.)
  - Provides tool discovery and invocation
  - Handles authentication and session management

### Integrated Benefits
- **Trusted Execution**: Combines IPFS immutability with WASM sandboxing
- **Decentralized AI**: Enables distributed AI tool hosting and execution
- **Interoperability**: Standard MCP protocol connects all components
